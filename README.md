Learn 100 of the most common words in French
In this software you can learn 100 of the most common words in French, this is a card game that shows you a card that has a word written in French and after 3 seconds flips over and shows its translation in English. If you know the word you press the button accordingly and the word will disappear from the cards and so you will slowly learn the words.
In the code I use TKINTER, CSV files through PANDAS and more.
